# TODO

## Experiments

- Serializing
  - Escaping and Unescaping pairs (instead of only unescaping)
  - Calculate ambiguous **ToString** cases
  - Generate **ToString** algorithm
- Loop priority
- Document the algorithm in a markdown file
- From a given state and a few tokens, the trace graph could be copied directly if:
  - none of state.returnStacks is reduced
  - competitions created before the first token are not attended
  - completitions created after the first token are closed

## Development

1. [ ] Create a new repo `BuildTools` and adapt the release license instead of the development license.
2. [ ] Review all comments.

## Work Items (issues)

- Print correct codeRange for `ParserErrorType::RuleIsIndirectlyLeftRecursive`.
- Optimize `CrossReferencedNFA` to merge prefix (two states can be merged if their `InEdges` are identical, `FromState` in `InEdges` are replaced by merged states).
  - Issue: `X ::= ([a] | [b]) c` fails because when both optional syntax fail it creates two trace routes to c and causes ambiguity.
- `JsonEscapeString` `JsonUnescapeString` handle surrogate pairs correctly.

## Work Items (investigation)

- Fix todo in `TraceManager::AreTwoEndingInputTraceEqual`.
- Generate LL parser if possible (print error if failed but forced to do)
- Generate SLR parser if possible (print error if failed but forced to do)

## Work Items (enhancement)

- Switching lexical analyzer during parsing.
  - Refactor some properties in `LexerSymbolManager` into `LexerFile` with a name.
- AST uses classes from another AST file in dependency as fields.
- Printing AST classes that created from a memory pool.
- All `token` property `X` becomes `X_`, paired with a string property `X` to access the text value in `X_`.
- New priority syntax
  - Priority in alternative syntax, but all branches must not consume empty input series (add compile error)
  - Priority in left recursive transition (which clause starts this competition?)
- Custom error in syntax.
- Error recovering.
- Extensible tokens, for example, recognize `R"[^\s(]\(` and invoke a callback function to determine the end of the string.
  - Offer two options: using (rich regex | C++) to search for complete token.
- Escaping and unescaping functions
  - Offer two options: experiment
  - Map positions between escaped and unescaped text
